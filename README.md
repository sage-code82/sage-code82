👋 Hello There! I'm Stephen, a coding enthusiast who very recently (August 23) embarked on the exciting journey into the world of programming. 🚀

🎓 I recently graduated from a MERN Fullstack coding bootcamp with the cracking team at Tech Educators, where I took my first steps into the vast and dynamic realm of web development. From crafting responsive user interfaces to building robust server-side applications, I've gained hands-on experience with the modern tech stack of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

🌱 As well as practicing my newly discoverd MERN Fullstack super powers, I am currently teaching myself the wonders of NEXT.js via freeCodeCamp, CodeAcademy and Dave Gray's YouTube channel.

💡 Eager to expand my skills and contribute to innovative projects, I am on a continuous learning path, exploring new technologies and refining my coding prowess. I believe in the power of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and building a supportive community within the tech industry.  

🌐 Check out my repositories below to explore the projects I've worked on during my coding bootcamp journey. From tackling real-world challenges to experimenting with creative ideas, each project has been a stepping stone in my learning process.

🚀 Let's connect, collaborate, and code together! Feel free to reach out for discussions, mentorship, or simply to share our coding adventures. Happy coding! 🖥️💻
